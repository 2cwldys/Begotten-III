<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Misunderstood Legacy</b></font>

The Blagoona's, a greatly misrepresented, misunderstood legacy that stems from eons ago, in the times of Glazic discovery, built itself after a remarking young man by the name of Blagoona Torquez ventured into the abyss of a inhospitable spot known as the African continent. At which, this man utilized great spiritual abilities to guide himself to the light. Blagoona Torquez began his reign of power after the establishment of faith in the African continent. At which he began his worship on the darkhides alike, but soon grew angry and distressed. The initial reasoning for this is yet unknown, but what is told in stories dating back to the beginning of Glaze and its formation, was that the original faith bonding phase did not go as planned, and Torquez felt an immediate disconnection between his mind and the faith he was building upward.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Booby Blagoona - His faith, the people... and the beginning</b></font>

In a time of chaos and circumcision came Booby Blagoona as the notorious the darkhide from the far reaches of a Glazic discovery. What was unheard by the Blagoona family, was that they were characters of great strength and ability. They looked for outreaches in their ways of guidance. They traveled very far and very boldly, and these characters of great ability, great mastery and great vigilance will go on to tell their stories in the afterworld. The attentiveness of the darkhide backbone stems from the Blagoona family. A long family tree that goes back generations and even eons. What's even more amazing about these creatures of animalistic nature, was their diligence towards the prize of the watermelon. These charasmatic creatures gave birth to a new age of reason and mindfulness. These characters known as the Blagoonas came forth from an age of iron and steel, and threw themselves at the world for the world to see. There was no stopping Booby Blagoona, a man risen to show the time of his age that he was up for the task of uniting the darkhide tribes, and so he did.

Booby himself was a master that rose from the times of chaos and destruction. It was when the Hard-Glaze philosophy was no-longer around, but the Darkhide, bounded by his brotherhood. However, one would have thought the darkhide was bound to his brothers, but times were different. The darkhide was in a conflict of civil war. A time where dark hides alike did not think otherwise why they would kill one-another. Believing in the Dark Hide prophecy was like believing in the possibilities of utter destruction on a global scale for dark-hide predecessors... but they indeed prevailed along with their giant strides of justification.

Booby went from a child to a grown man with the hairs under the arms, and the grease lingering to his sack. He was a tall giant with a humble personality, but a nasty side of him that scorched what the world tried to do to help him. Not only that, but Booby Blagoona was a lot different from his forefather, the Torquez. He was no-longer in fact white, but a dark-hide person, with an intact brain and heart that effortlessly demanded for the watermelon, and the visualization of a dark-hide victory over other dark-hides that jeopardized the integrity of the tribes.

Much like other dark hides around him, he grew up in poverty where poverty was the only thing he knew. It was at one point as Blagoona grew old and as time went, that he wanted more out of his life, and so he grew from a small branch on the plant of solitude, to a man very talkative in nature and profound in speech. And what he did to further his education, was read the relics of what was left behind after the Spanish embarkation of the African Continent many years ago. He read on and on. It was said by many that it would be days before anyone would realize Booby was gone from his home in the community. He would sit by the river outside of society and soak in the information of Spanish literary mastery. Quitting was no-longer part of Blagoona, so he continued and persevered to understand what these Spanish literary pieces meant to him.. He wanted to decipher what it all meant, and indeed he did.

It was a warm August morning when Blagoona made farewells to his people of inner Humanity. Family, friends, all alike were gifted the farewells of compassion and sympathy from him. He knew he had to move on with life, and so he did... very soon actually. It was only that evening on the same day that he departed for the greatness he always wanted, a new experience in life in the next journey he would come to. 

The next morning it was documented that his village was savagely destroyed by a nearby rival tribe... Booby would discover the abandonment of his home village many years after in the tale of his return to the African continent as a great poet. Those who lived with him were either killed or enslaved and he would want revenge for it all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Tale of Beauty Inside</b></font>

The tale so goes that as the grand poet Booby Blagoona stepped onto the pedestal and gave forth his first speech, many years later, that all eyes glistened and focused on the master at his finest. It was only then that every body in the crowd felt his inner beauty, his majestic nature, his intelligence. The stars sparkled under the night of a man in soaked in the passions of speech. He gave forth the words later deciphered by Spanish Hard-Glaze translators and literary genuises associated. These words go as following:

"I want the world to know, the darkhides and Glazic warriors, keep fighting, but know what you are fighting for in this world. I want you all to understand the embodiment of a proportional the darkhide. It is I, Blagoona. Do not stop fighting may I say, but do know what you are fighting for in this world. Understand, comprehend the wars that go on in this world. As I firmly place my hand on my chest, and read out the Glazic scriptures, I want all to twinkle with vitality."
-The Great Blagoona, Booby Blagoona, as he speaks with robustness on behalf of a 30,000 person parade in the Capitol of Glaze itself. Lord Maximus tunes in on this gathering, watching from above in his bedroom window in envy.

Book_Booby_Page4 = [[
An uproar of Powder boys and Glazic Guardians scrambled to their feet and began a displacement in the capital's parade. It is said that during this change in behavior, noblemen and peasants together within the walls of the Capitol had gained a huge surge of rebellion in their hearts from Blagoona's speech, and had sent the entire city on a full lockdown status alert. Every door in the Garden of Glaze put on full lock-down. Soldiers were struggling to stop the rioting as the city went into a full-fledged outbreak. Infrastructure destroyed, burnt to the ground. Even the Royal escort vehicle was flipped upside down in the road and torched to a crisp by the rioters. All of this commotion only got worse, when the Royal Palace was surrounded by a lynch mob of angry protesters, all wanting to kill Lord Maximus for his hatred of Blagoona and the enslaved the darkhide populace.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Esteemed Writer and Visionary</b></font>

Boxer Harvus Krammy (b. 3E d. 4E), was a Hard-Glazed author, humorist, philosopher, researcher, and Royal Senator. He is universally acclaimed for his works, including the world-famous The Perpetual Urges and its lost-to-time sequel, The Persistent Urges. Krammy, in his younger years as a Hard-Glazed researcher, contributed to the immensely valued and important research document, The Darkhide Manifesto, which forever changed the way that the Phillimonjios viewed the Darkhide, as well as The Festering Darkhide Bypass.

Though Krammy at the height of his career was among the richest men in all of the world, it soon came crashing down. Indeed, throughout his life Krammy was plagued by never-ending scandals. However, regardless of this, he was a man highly respected by those in the Royal Senate, including his enemies. Even Lord Maximus himself held Krammy as a dear friend. Ironically, Krammy died at Lord Maximus' orders, executed by spooning due to the controversy surrounding The Perpetual Urges.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Early Life</b></font>

Not much is known of Krammy's early life, other than that he attended university in District 1 and that his name appeared in many essays and research documents dating from the late Third Era. It would appear that he was an esteemed researcher of the darkhide mind in his early years, but soon decided to take up penmanship, writing many short stories and novels deeply rooted in Hard-Glazed culture.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Political Career and Fateful Duel</b></font>

In the last years of the Third Era, Krammy was instated by the Lord's decree to the office of Senatorial Advisor to the Royal Senate. This appointment was a prestigious one, bringing with it the benefits and respect of noble life. However, it was revealed by an investigation shortly after Krammy's death that Krammy had always despised the Royal Senate. Fragments from his diary state that Krammy thought the Royal Senate "prioritized morality" when it came to the darkhides. Indeed, during the turbulent times of the Fourth Era, the Royal Senate passed legislation that forbade the darkhides' masters from striking them for disobedience.

It is hotly debated to this day on whether or not this act was passed because the Royal Senate sympathized with the plight of the black man, or if they believed that the beatings hampered how much a the darkhide could produce, and therefore the economy. Krammy also believed that the Royal Senate were "incompetent fools", and "corrupt as a the darkhide's mind after the sight of a white lady". Krammy's suspicions were proven correct after the collapse of the Royal Senate, but Krammy never lived to see their punishment.

As Senatorial Advisor, Krammy had access to the entirety of the Royal Senate, and was present during all decision-making. He used his position to accomplish two main goals: undermining the Royal Senate and advancing his political career. His second goal was fulfilled when Krammy was appointed as an official Royal Senator upon the death of the leader of the National Faith Party. Krammy often obtained evidence of corruption from within the ranks of the Royal Senate, and then used this evidence to blackmail corrupt senators into doing his bidding to cause public opinion of the Royal Senate to waiver. This made Krammy many enemies in the Royal Senate, and among them was the leader of the Royal Aristocratic Party, Thomas Edwards. The rivalry only worsened when Krammy was elected as leader of the National Faith Party, which was the most powerful party in the Royal Senate.
]]

Book_Boxer_Page3 = [[
Edwards' opposition to Krammy's ambitions eventually lead to a fierce rivalry between the two, where both men would openly denounce each other on the Royal Senate floor to the respective applause of their supporting parties and jeering by the other. Eventually, their rivalry would culminate in a famous duel in which both Edwards and Krammy were nearly killed. This incident left both of them recovering for months, and so both major political parties in the Royal Senate were without their leaders. Consequently, this left Krammy blameless for the Royal Senate's involvement in the emancipation scandal, a defining moment in Hard-Glazed history which separates the Third Era from the Fourth Era. However, some speculate that Krammy may have sown the seeds for the scandal in the first place, attempting to destroy the Royal Senate from within.

As a direct result of the Royal Senate's involvement, Lord Maximus crippled the power of the Royal Senate for good, including the dismissal of every Royal Senator including those not involved. Krammy, now powerless and without a source of income, returned to authorship.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Perpetual Urges and Controversy</b></font>

Even as Krammy took up the mantle of Advisor to The Royal Senate, a laborious and strenuous job, he still continued to work on novels and stories for the masses. However, he was forced to abandon his pursuits in writing upon becoming an official Royal Senator, returning after being dismissed by Lord Maximus.

After the passing of the Fourth Erotica Ban (22) by the new Royal Senate, Krammy had decided that he'd "had enough with the Royal Senate's games". He sought to inspire the masses to revolt against the oligarchy and install a new, democratic senate in its place. It was during his time of peak suspicion and hatred of the Royal Senate that he completed his greatest masterpiece, The Perpetual Urges. It quickly became a bestseller, and is widely regarded to be the single most impactful work in all of Hard-Glazed history. Because of the success of The Perpetual Urges, Boxer H. Krammy became a household name. Yet, the vast audiences who had read Krammy's work had ignored the deeper message within, and Krammy soon found himself frustrated that the Royal Senate was still in power.

At the same time, many of the more conservative in the population (and indeed the Royal Senate) were offended by the vulgarity and radical new concepts that it proposed. The Royal Senate knew that something had to be done about Krammy, and so began a master plan which would eventually lead to Krammy's fall from grace.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Later Life and Execution</b></font>

The Royal Senate chastised Krammy in the middle Fourth Era, citing the fact that The Perpetual Urges was a likely bypass to the Fourth Erotica Ban (22). Times were becoming more turbulent due to the rapid industrialization, and dark-hide unrest was rising. The political and social backlash was immediate. Krammy was stripped of all honorary titles and his bank accounts were frozen. All of his works and originals were confiscated, though for some unknown reason his published works remained unbanned and available to the general public. Krammy retired to a log cabin deep in the outskirts of the future District 3. During this time he wrote poetry about the depressing smokestacks of the encroaching factories as more were built, and began work on a sequel to The Perpetual Urges, called The Persistent Urges. However, as his next great work was nearing completion, the Royal Senate took further action to impede Krammy. One night, while Krammy was visiting District 1 to recite poetry for Lord Maximus himself, unknown assailants burnt Krammy's cabin to the ground. Lost were many historical artifacts of utmost importance, as Krammy was a collector of antiquities. Some of the artifacts lost included items from the Old World, pre-dating Glazic society. Additionally, while Krammy was in District 1, the Royal Senate organized riots against Krammy and The Perpetual Urges. In face of mass social unrest and a possible collapse of society, Lord Maximus had Krammy condemned to die by spooning. His last words were reportedly "At once I superfluously gave spokesmen like myself the rant of a lifetime. I will not let these boisterous the darkhides intrude on the Confederate league of baboons known as the Redneck Allegiance Party. Maybe because I'm kindhearted, but not for now will that happen in the eyes of the very Senate. We must ally with these redneck fucklets, if we are to make way." The true meaning of these words remains unclear, as the Redneck Allegiance Party had been long been dead since before the Holy Hierarchy Wars.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>County Districts</b></font>

The 'County Districts' refer to the Glaze-owned territories along the border separating the Glaze and the Gore. These districts are typically of lower quality, and are the only districts under control of the Ministers, and not the Small Senate. Many consider these districts to not actually be part of the Hard-Glazed system, and are rather independent villages owned by peasants of the Goreic Kingdom. This superstition is met with the fact that the 'Goreic Kingdom' in its own right, is not actually a kingdom, but rather a broken faith system with no official ruling class. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Discovery</b></font>

Dating back to the dawn of the First Era, the Goreic Kingdom started off in a shroud of mystery. Originally thought to be a mad cult of northern folk, the Glazic nobility paid them little attention. Early serflings would report to their local Minister about 'mad mountain-men and spearfolk, white of skin' who would watch their villages at a distance. Legends and tales were spread across the districts, about these men, who had white skin but acted like dark folk without any master. 

It was not until the Second Era, in the ashes of the recent Hierarchy wars, that the Royal Senate heard word of the Goreic Kingdom. It was said that a local county district's tradition was to send their village elders to the north, so that they would become one with the snow. For years they would send their elders into the cold winds of the north, and none would return. This changed when an elder returned from their quest with a 'ghastly look,' and a word of their findings in the Northlands. His findings were immediately reported to the Royal Senate, detailing a face-to-face with these men, who called themselves 'the Gores' and spoke of false gods that were of anti-Glazic intent.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Kingdoms</b></font>

"I suppose It'd be quite requisitory of the Royal Senate to enact a burdening response to these recent attacks on our peasant friends. To sit back, wait, and hope for a digression? Simply put, these Spearfolk must be swiftly cut down before they grow in number." 
—V.K Heimann - the 'Steel Tongue' of his days.

Around late phase of the Second Era, Goreic encounters have grown from legendary to quite common and then annoyingly frequent. From ambassador intelligence to captured Spearfolk, it was apparent that a great number of Goreic men were actually once of Glazic faith, and have converted over. Life among these people is extremely simple, their day consisting of crawling around in dark underground tunnels, or in cold villages on the mountains. Strangely, when asked what these men believe in, each response will vary. 

According to the beliefs of the Gores, a great set of deities rule over the world, known as the 'Family.' This family, consisting of two brothers, a sister, a mother, and a father, had created the world by 'finding the way.' The names of these deities never seem to be agreed on, but their roles seem unanimously known. The mother is the caretaker, the voice of reason. The father is the hunter, the seeker of nourishment for the family, but without the other members of the family to support him, he is nothing. The first brother is intelligent, but lacks communion. The second brother is of great communion, but lacks intelligence. The sister is the trickster, who causes troubles for the family, but will also help the family in time of need.

There is no noble class of these Gore people, but only a single faith system that guides them all. A series of schisms along the county districts have called for various purges to occur, but for every dead Gore another rises to take their place. Goreic activities have become widespread knowledge after the late Goreic Purges called by Minister Willtan that resulted in an absolute suppression of the Spearfolk militia. Despite our victories, it will indeed be a great struggle before these beast-men are completely removed from the glaze of Sol.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Gay King Summit</b></font>

"They have many names to be exact. Some call them 'bizzaros' or 'the sinless,' 'mystified ones,' or "pilgrims," 'messengers,' 'decipoles,' 'creators,' destroyers',' 'immigrants,' 'enemies,' 'friends,' 'the mysterious.' 'Gays.' 
I will only call them 'strangers.' Only that." 
- Millar C. Pance, N. Goeric-Glaze Regional Administration. Senior Officer & Artillery Commander - April 23rd, L. Holy Hierarchy Wars.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Summary</b></font>

Hard-Glaze historians argue that the 'Gay Graves Incidents,' now commonly referred to as the Gay King Summit, officially marked the end of the Holy Hierarchy wars, and precurser to the solidification for todays policies put in place, allowing all legal homosexuals residing in the Empire to be granted their well-deserved freedoms. It is said that the Gay King Summit was also a game changer in the nations defence policies, and several popular political movements rised out from it, allowing for tighter immigration reform, and security concerns to be addressed by the imperial cabinet. 

For homosexuals. Although a number of laws have been attempted over time, and gays today in Hard-Glaze society are still coined equivilent to a the darkhide slave, much has improved, for instance allowing legal Gays to work additional time in the fields. 

Many have contested that the Gay King Summit had no correlation with the Holy Hierarchy Wars at all, but was popular for a number of unconfirmed reasons (conspiracy.)

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Beginning</b></font>

Millar C. Pance was a military tactician during thump and clash of the very well identified Holy Hierarchy Wars. A well deserved champion, however with troubling reoccurences of almost dying in combat. It was when Millar brushed over an angel in the green, that he was wiped clean of all impurities, everlastingly. 

It was April 23rd, when two political heros and serious competitors of Goreic ancestry were prepared for quick execution, inside a primitive village isolation aside the Goreic mountain passes. Each perpetrator responsible for the genocide of an entire Glazic mining community. It was up to Millar to clean the residue left over after all campaigns in the northern Goreic-Glaze regions. So he arranged a date, and when that date came, he ordered his firing squad to load lethals and commence on the two prisoners of war. As he was doing so, a strange white figure emerged from behind a large oak tree on the outside of the perimeter where a thick treeline was. Russling branches were heard, and the general turned his head with a cocked eyebrow. 

The prideful Millar C. Prance welcomed this time traveler with open arms, using this unidentified stranger as peace and prosperity, in written memos to solidify hope on the Glazic Empires faded, wartorn regions. 

...thus this began a new hidden evil for them all, so let the light help where help is due...

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>"These ... Strange Men"</b></font>

"They rose from the ashes of a terrible conflict and gave hope to the nation, but that was only the beginning..." 

-Charles Simmons, Drill Sergeant under command of Gen. Millar C. Prance. Second man to witness the first encounter. April 23rd, L. Holy Hierarchy Wars. 

Strangers are no dispute in an empire that is powerful enough to reign hell on rayless beings of charcoal, a true land of gold, house of cultural diversity even when dark hides are crust, shit, or simply both. As always, the diversity allows for the fowls of evil to be admitted their blessings from The Glaze. It was the Gay Kings Men however, that stuttered the speech of noble spokesmen allowed the greatest titles. Sabre clung gentlemen, the hardest of fowl-mouthed raiders in to kill for coin. 

Soothe blanketed soldiers pledging an oath to unfair tactics. Even these souls, shortly trained and seasoned in the art of powder, they had no bicker with such mystified ones. And a thick-skinned highness that held the imperial purse and emblematic family trophies, all in duel and humorless play in the fields; no match were any of these positions of those brandishing purity to the end of their days, which the Glaze would deem. 

As these homos of strangeness continued their discussed odyssies from uncharted estates, now plagued by the Holy Hierarchy conflicts. Once places already of unconventional government and oddball customs, it was a no-brainer to many, that these mystified beings almost all distinguished with the brightest silken white capes of biblical proportion. They would come from the nuisances of the world, and challenge a superpower of the world. 
]]

Book_Gay_Page4 = [[
They looked to find refuge or worse in a triumphant nation at best, but who is to say the coin is not turned to reveal the Glazic people and their lookings for salvation. Only one would hope not, for the Glaze is all they knew, and hopes to only know when darkness shrouded the world, as history tends to repeat itself. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Arrival of The Evil Sentiment</b></font>

The strangers received zero backlash, as the country itself was hanging on the balance, with a war in the closing, and the leftover destruction unimaginable. So when these interesting beings arrived, making their first appearances in autonomous regions bordering Goeric mountains, it was no wonder that all banded together and greeted these fascinating ones. Those who would seem to magically morph from thin air into the many neighboring treelines, walking endlessly from wherever they came from through enormous plains of grass and farmland, and oversize themselves with dozens of old luggage bags, tokens of gratitude and spirituality (or gifts for refuge), and the iconic silk woven capes they hid their faces under. 

These capes a mirror image of priests in the times of the Rising Sun and before. So perhaps when General Millar witnessed the first figure appear in the trees, and this "stranger" magically walking over with little to communicate, The General had almost in a sense, had a vision himself, thinking that perhaps a time traveler was in visiting their time to survey the destruction of long since Holy Hierarchy Wars, and the taunting residue it left behind, and carrying the truths for the future of a nation. Questions much like, "will the empire rise again, will we triumph over evildoers, and will we become the light itself and not just puppet worshippers, all seeking the same truth we so desperately need in these times of contortion."

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Immortal Awakenings (A Child Abduction)</b></font>

A terrible scheme of backstabbing had surfaced after six months from when a powerful being was discovered, in one of outlying Goeric-Glaze autonomous regions, known for the first sightings of travelers by the Hard-Glaze commander. The story so goes, that a young boy onwards to becoming an apprentice hunter, only at the time coming of age, had traveled with his grand father deep into the forests almost bordering the mysterious Goeric lands. This boy was innocent, and never thought much of what he was doing. He was going by what his grand father had instructed him to do, both of them originally together on a pleasant hunting trip. It was until the boy was specifically told by the wiser man to go fetch five items of the land, that something had happened. It was told in order as is. 

"Child do as I say.. recite the words three times after me. I acquire these five things." 
And so the child listened attentively, eyes wide awake. 
"One Portobello Mushroom from the largest of ancestors oak tree." 
"One picking of Microsorum Pteropus, three leaves each." 
"One Dryopteris Filix-Mas, one single leaf." 
"One slice of wet bark from last nights sprinkle, found on a oak tree of our ancestors." 
"And finally one handful of the purest red berries, careful not to be poisonous." 

The boys grand father told the boy to open his hand, where the man gently placed a cold dagger in, and slowly had the boy close his clutch around it protectively. He also put his very own leather satchel on the boys frail body, over his small shoulders, and kissed the boy on his forehead before sending him on his way. 

As the boy marched hesitantly into uncharted territory that became increasingly dark and moist, the elder shouted through the trees for him:
]]

Book_Gay_Page6 = [[
"Child, remember the five things I require, and return for supper and you will make me a happy man. I have faith in you!" 

The boy yelled "Yes pappa!" before continuing onwards into the void. 

It was two hours into the wilderness that the boy had found himself confused and lost, unable to retrace his steps as told times before, and the little one finally had found himself slumped up against a tree with none of the five things anywhere in sight. The boy felt himself falling asleep, exhausted from the long voyage, and had awakened to the sounds of night owls, crickets, and russling in the nearby bushes. He had lost track of time and clearly disobeyed his elders instruction to return at supper. 

As the boy gathered himself and prepared to try and find his way back home, the he couldn't help but notice out of the corner of his eye, a white glimmer that stood out in the darkness, strangely grabbing the younglings attention. 

The boy decided to follow the glimmering orb in the world without light, and it had felt like an endless tunnel he walked through, each step growing the orb larger and larger. The boy continued towards the orb until the glimmer had suddenly shifted into a dramatic beam that shot out in his face like a sword, blinding the child enough for him to have to squint hard. 

Gradually as the light engulfed the childs entire perspective, his vision recovered as well, allowing him to witness a world that appeared to mimic a place that put the greatest Hard-Glaze wonders to shame. Those being artificial and nothing more, and this seeming more real than anything ever witnessed. 
]]

Book_Gay_Page7 = [[
In the boys underdeveloped mind, he had perceived this incredible sight as the Light itself, but was still unsure what it actually was. The belief of it being The Light however, was remarkably a reasonably agreed concept imbedded in Hard-Glaze society at the time. It was, as taught in Hard-Glaze classes he had attended in his younger years. 

The child in that moment, thought what he was witnessing was some strange fever that triggered an onset hallucination, perhaps from a form of poison ivy he sat in when falling asleep in the forest. But there was no evidence of iritation or markings on his skin, checking himself furiously. It was a strange phenomenon the boy could not explain, and as happening he felt more compelled to discover what it could all mean. 

Time had seemed to cease, as the brightness toned easier on the eyes, allowing for the little one to see the captivating dreamscape. It was a recognisable Capitol District and the typical outskirts, but suddenly the powerful light emerged again for a brief minute, before fading one final time. 

At this point a thick haze had taken the place of the overwhelming light, directly overlapping the cityscape that was seen only moments ago. The Capitol Districts current design, Post-Holy Hierarchy Wars, then transformed after leftover haze into something only envisioned by the greatest intellectuals Lord Maximus could muster up in society. The city now standing as a miraculous showpiece beyond any one persons comprehension, a positive vision of the future. 

All of society had shifted into the brightest future in the blink of the kids eyes, in a state that presented itself best described as silver and gold surfacings everywhere the iris could saturate. A rich society that allowed elegance without baggage. The infrastructure notorious, with colossal skyscapers, towering over streets and overpasses, all materialized into very intelligible design to show a still triumphant society, this time revived to its former glory. Other things were witnessed afar.

Objects, very sophisticated in design, somehow suspended miles in the air. These were the first spaceships, sharing the skies with other vehicles, before the erupting with powerful boosters that put the fastest white stallions to shame and taking it into space. Beams of energy shooting directly in the air, many of these energy pockets situated all over the place, any areas one could not even conceivably think, across the skyline forming colorful spires through the clouds, piercing the atmosphere above. 

The land was fresh and cleansed of chemicals and pollutions left after a terrible war labeled Holy Hierarchy. A land showered sweet from sorrow and chaos that plagued the people of its time. It was the most beautiful thing one person could witness, and a simpleton kid who found it through a light, had been stunted, frozen in his place completely, absorbing everything at once. 

The child watched as little ants moved across the skyline, the land timelapsing into morning, evening, night, and repeat.. People in their daily lives. Society in motion, and noone to stop any of it, as the beauty seemed to contine endlessly like a simulation, the shining imagery then began to quickly dim into darkness, and the eyes of the child shielded once again.. he blinked, realizing what now was infront if him. Something wasn't right here at all.

After five back to back days of fear and anguish in the local community the boy resided in, the regional governor had received word of the tragedy, and under the pressures of the entire populace the man delivered a notion of action. He spited every fucker peasant deterring him from finishing a mediocre meat platter that tasted as dry as disgusting old peasant nibble.

But in his eyes the best thing yet. This royal pig fake having never visited the Capitol District at all. With all of the governments coffers for a piss-poor autonomous region in bankrupcy, this unsavory man had an angry fit from being kept from finishing his plate. But it was before coming to his senses about the rumored lost child, that he quickly made a change in heart and stamped the official paperwork with a red seal, one that meant official, and that a search party was legally underway, and that could ensue.

So as required, a semi-efficient militia troop was assembled from the barracks, but it was the slowest most undisciplined fighting force, many of these men a coarse type, but admired for their rugged backgrounds of toughness atleast. However these men were corrupt type at large, and seen as uncivilized and a world apart from the nobles residing outside of these counties. The troop itself was also struggling, but atleast they had weapons to use.

The marksmen brandished longbows with limited arrows, and the rest of the troop carried variations of spears and the dullest Goeric warblades decades old, and only a select few actually held onto a somewhat impressive gunpowder piece passed down from unimpressive legacy holders. It was the most this fighting force could build up, as the outlying counties were hit the hardest in the wake of Holy Hierarchy Wars, where all resources had suddenly vanished. 

The two men identified carrying such guns was the Governor himself, having noone reliable and trustworthy enough to command a fighting force in the fields. At his side nothing more than an ignorant, blatantly clueless weakling. His very own stepson. The imbecile thought once as being retarded. The governor was like many Goeric-Glaze rulers at the time however, trapped in poverty and accustomed to dirty work that placed him almost on a level to his own serfs. But it was his stupid stepson given the powers to inherit the pathetic bankrupcy incase death struck swift, because honestly who cared/which made things slightly easier even when things didn't seem so good.

So the army was mobilizing with what dwindling troops it could encourage, and a few somewhat decent officers were told to sprint to nearby townships and villages and knock on every door to a home, and stir the pot. Efforts to claim additional numbers to find the boy were met with resistance, and these dimwitted officers were being inefficient in everything they did, not to even say professional in the slightest. 

It was dark already, and people settling inside for the night were awakened by the loudest knocking and shouting of orders. As clear as the moon, this was no ordinary search party it seemed, as a child going missing was something people never thought would happen in communities where lessons were taught the hard way, and Goeric-Glaze ideas intermingled and gave false impressions to keep children from being naughty, or stupid in the forests adults would not go. 

As the news of a search party continued, the ragtag soldiers flashed a small artists interpretation of the boy, the shittiest inaccurate picture from the Governors worst painter. These pictures were shoved aggressively in peoples faces, and if unable to answer the simplest question of who this boy was, the scumbags in power would chop open throats/loot bread/move to the next. Everybody around the small region knew what the kid looked like however, given these were small family communities where people knew if the Governor was sleeping around with several of the villagers wives, when the husbands were working hard in the mines all day. 

The entire village square was trashed and littered, with enraged villagers storming back to their homes to gather up the weapons. Women and children seeked shelter, and only the faintest of heart in these categories decided to follow the masses. It was witnessed that the mothers would drag their crying infants by their arms to safety, but the fathers being so crazed would knock around everywhere, like drunkards and step over the fallen younglings. Other children were summoned to watch after the town as the adults would hunt down the kidnapper.

The commutal center was lit like an inferno of fire, but the rest of the streets and areas were pitchblack. Quickly more and more villagers assembled with pitchforks and farm equipment, all bluntforce objects it seemed, and those who questioned such overreacting peoples were put on a blacklist for later wrist slashing. All of the wisest elders were forced into the commutal gathering, and told to present clues into the whole mess. It was until the oldest of the elders had spoke out and silenced the entire rabble, that everybody stormed out of the gates with their lanterns and their murdering tools. 

"It's the fucking ol' the darkhide that kidnapped that poor child! The only the darkhide who lives here!" 

The lynchmob fought through the gates, and smaller search parties were starting to construct once outside. The Governor had only then arrived to witnessed what he had intentionally started earlier, ontop of a black steed with metal plates covering its eyes, armed to the teeth with the mans unshown potential. 

Travel gear mixed in with military grade hardware, all the necessary killing parts like spare swords and lengths of rope for hanging fucklets, bundled up into pockets hanging from the side of the horse. But all of the war parts seemed mundane in comparison to the decapitated head of a Goeric criminal, skewered ferociously on a mount sitting above the saddle like a flag. The governor had a grimace of sincere evil on his face. People were crying, but also angry and ready to kill. Even the leftover children of the township were heard on the inside, singing together a sinister death chant with their innocent voices.

The more agile boys able to weld a weapon were sent out to light bonfires in random places across the dark field opening, and as these fires lit ablaze massively, they started to attract more and more people across the lands. These were beacons of an emergency. The devoutly religious and fanatic would serve the Governor and fuel his cause, and end up traveling oceans of geography to finally organize along with the others. This whole commotion was no ordinary lynchmob assembling, but a historic milestone, and there would be an endless surplus of warm bodies in for sweet revenge. 

The fire piles were gigantic, and were only said to have been used once in a blue moon. As burning fuels smokestacked the starry night, strange foreign noises would erupt over all the chaotic people every several minutes. These being indicators that that a new party had only just arrived. Each horn a distinct echo that represented Goeric family and tradition. The new arrivals would start off as a small group, but it would end up being atleast thirty minutes or more, before an estimated five hundred bloodthirsty fuckers had marched out into the grassy plain opening to greet the governor. 

Eye witnesses reported that the governor exchanged handshakes and Goeric prayers, before opening a pouch and dropping precious gems in each leaders hands.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>A Goeric-Glaze Dispute</b></font>

The Goeric re-enforcements had arrived at request, and the governor had gold coins in his eyes. He dismounted to salute the toughest Gore chieftains he could find in the outback, and these warriors stood still with unreadable expressions, as they expected something "more serious." These warriors looked as if they were living in caves for a milinium. Giant muscular males with the longest unkempt beards ever seen. 

These guys put the governors toughest militia to pity, and the meatiest man alive in rank stepped aside as the Goerics entered the governors caravan. It sent a true message to the troops. These newly found Gores wore sticky oils of red coating most of their exposed underareas, many obvious refusers of wearing girl outfits, and the entire team reeked horribly like some kind of dead the darkhide in the sun. It was all a true sign of an overreaction on the Governors part, and now he had to pay the price for it. Over a fucking child lost. 

All Gore regulars carried the similar, but it was the three distinct big guys that held the prize. These commanders known for nasty guerilla tactics had salvaged armor likely from corpsed army generals of the past. They carried a combination of priced artifacts passed down from warchief to warchief, all stemming old Goeric-Glaze conflicts that raged their homelands, and yet they were speaking with a considered enemy.

The governor had no quarrel with these men, they'd rip his fucking face off in a heartbeat. So he bowed servitude to THEM, and kneeled very presentable infront with one foot supported like a jester. Somewhat ashamed about all of this, and feeling he was embarassing his army, he cracked a sarcastic smile as if it was all some kind of joke. Typical enough, these Goeric generals had seen it all, and were unphased by his pathetic princess gesture, and some failed to even notice the bow. Now they only looked at the idiocy going on around them. 

The governor stood up, and the biggest of all big Gore chieftains made a grumbling sound with his mouth, chomping on a straw of hay and looking ahead like deep in thought. His name was Glaymore Bumbostomp, and his title gave light on what he loved doing - stomping skulls to chedder. Bumbostomp finally crossed eyes with the now profusely sweating Glaze governor, and started to reach into his very own personal bag. From there he very intentionally pulled out a very large object from the flap, as slow as Humanly possible. Stomp had to place it on both hands at once - it being that heavy, and when the Governor finally understood, all he could do was cry. 
<font color='#222' size='12'><b><i>"Spite the fools!"</i></b></font>
- The words of famous governor Alexander Pantis, as he urged his bodyguards to attack the Goeric giants.

It was a destroyed skull, only parts of the jaw still remaining, and Bumbostomp was unsatisfactory about the gem tributes given to him and his other friends. He wanted something else, and it was annexation of the township, the full region, and all neighboring farms and assets available. He also ordered for the governor to give up rights to the castle estate already falling into disrepair.

If unable to comply, the Goreic hordes would besiege the township and torch every living and non living thing, and plague the land with an immersurable quantity of illnesses, aswell as make the governors domain a hotspot for fielding armies to penetrate Hard Glaze soil. Essentially Bumblestomp was a visionary, and wanted to obtain ownership. Given that the Gores are immune to their sicknesses they would plague the domain with, none of this was an issue either if diplomacy failed. Bumbostomp also promised that all surviving peoples of the land be converted to the Goeric belief system, and promised a surplus of sexual partners and riches in return. 

Right away the chaos had tripled and the governors bodyguards ran to his aid, unsheathing fancy swords. The governor begged the Gores with one fundemental question, as dozens of his security forces jumped into position to attack.

"Why is THIS land of value to you, kind sir?" 

Bumblestomps size made the governor pathetic, and Bumble motioned for a henchman to slowly lay down an antique suitcase. First the Gore held up a hand in the most lethargic way, and the bodyguards all reacted quickly to the motion, running backwards an estimated seven feet. All Glazic bodyguards soon enclosed again with persistence. The three giants not moving a muscle. The governmental security however acting like loyal mutts, jabbing and slicing the air with their flexible Rapier swords at the three colossal threats. "Open it fool" hollered Bumble, and the hostage Glazeman made a whimpering sound that some of his men grimaced to.

The governor continued the follow none the less, and cautiously lifted up the lid. A person popped out fast wearing a brightly stripe colored jumpsuit and cone hat -- of course Bumbles dwarf son, now laughing in a high pitched schizoid voice. One or two of the governors armed henchmen threw up their buckler shields tighter, as the little fuck appeared out of the small space. Just when things couldn't get worse, the governors timid state was overthrown by a sensation of pure hatrid and disgust, right in the heat of the moment, and he inched forward closest to the ugly ass midget, until he could see a nasty aids infested bump on its bottom lip. 

Spectators reported that the governor threw the hardest suckerpunch imaginable in the shits face. The midget Bumblestomp fell backwards in a bloody mess, bringing with him the suitcase, but the tiny jokster continued to laugh hysterically with a broken nose, squirming around like a worm. The midget and the suitcase collided with Bumblestomps legs, and everything at that moment busted out of control. People starting to die at an alarming rate. 

"The guards were using gentlemens fairness the first matter of seconds, but as men looked around at their best friends being lifted in the air and chucked, these troopers came to their senses, realizing they would not win this fight like that.." 

The three huge Gores having no time to waste, started plowing into everything without warning. The governor slipped away and screamed a defeaning three words: 

"Spite the fools!"

His shieldbearers created a sloppy testudo wall to cover him, while men from each wing did hit and run maneuvers. The giant fuckheads started ripping through the caravans wagons and supplies. Men were being thrown ridiculously high like ragdolls, and the very best Glaze Guards were butchered most violently until unrecognisable. Not a single Gore harmed, because these were the spoils of war, and the Gores knew it. So they continued to trash every element until blood ran deep in the lands heritage. The Governor managed to slip away untouched, but all of his best troops had been torn apart, limb from limb like the dumbest creatures. These Gores were known for inhumane treatment, and did not give the men a fighting chance. 

"Men are running in all directions, dropping their arms and fleeing. Some have discharged their powder shots but the balls are flying into a forest. I'm seeing advances two-fold. The enemy is advancing two-fold, and the Governors convoy has been demolished. the township is under attack, and our allies have betrayed us."

The township was seen for miles over pinetrees, engulfed in a maroon smoke. The governor managing to escape the undergoing mayhem, had barely outrun Goeric pursuers on foot to a nearby horse stable. There, he rode the last remaining steed to his fortified castle estate. 

The army was in shambles, men dragging their fallen peoples across the battlefield. Some made it outside the boundry, but found themselves being attacked by unchained the darkhides near overthrown plantations. 

As the Goreic-Glaze leader galloped to the crossroads of a once blossoming fishing commute, he had witnessed uninterrupted evil. The despairs of great peoples known for heroism, triumph over evil, perseverance, and the continuity of nobility -- A bloodline preserved for generations, and traced back to the even the first settlers. Now it was all gone, and this man was the reason for it. A stupid lord who inherited too much. 

He was the audience of such evils, nobody cared at all.

- When riding through, he was struck immensely. An almost surreal sight. Religious centers had been long since blackened by fires that occured, chapels, safe havens for everybody, used for sadistic pleasure. Manufacturing districts exploded from the inside out, all workers of these operations incinerated in seconds. 
- Departing out from the ghostly place, he became self aware of the all powerful Gore, and how they even stomped the seat of power. The magistrate had windows busted out, and gunpowder residue the proof of what happened. Tiny holes, atleast fifty or more had penetrated the front doors like a cheese gratter. These motherfuckers used grapeshot on the Mayor. 
- It was downpouring now and the lords tears were hidden through rain. He could not sustain, all emotion almost drained, making him colder and more vengeful. 
- Why? Why were these spoils of war allowed? Did these Gores have no discipline? Did they do this in sexual gratification? Why did they do this? It was too late to wonder, action was now needed. 

The Gores were unshy of letting corpsed fucklets marinate the slop dirt. The highness had to ride over a barricade of bodies in a military checkpoint. Loads of impaled suckers too, but not for feast but to rot wastefully in the weather. 

When riding out of the dead commute he had discovered masses of the darkhides, marching their own little make-believe armies out of the town. 

"Ahh, so the darkhide is working evils with the Gore...." 

These were the peasant infidels deemed forever imprisonment! Now these ape machines waved a Goeric-Glaze flag that was modified for a false the darkhide idol! So the man atop his horse looked a gaze sharp like daggers, scrutinizing these whores in motion.

Then the darkhides become lifetime skin eaters.' Let MY idol of light prevail, not yours!"

He was greeted by hundreds of surviving men congregating outside a swampy moat. The drawbridge was lifted up to keep their own men from entering the facility. It was only an hour and a half into the battle and men were retreating to their last line of defense. Troopers were heard in agony, doctors hastily working in tents to patch up the wounded, and those unable to be saved quickly shoved into makeshift graves that dug up the outer perimeter. Some were thrown in larger craters with dozens of others ontop, a mixture of dead and alive, many assumed already gone. Upon seeing the governor arrive on horseback, many of these defeated men gave an exhausted cheer. The lord bestowing a tired gesture himself, and numerous souls continued working at a snails pace with shovels. There were plenty of dead sons to bury in the earth. 

It was dark and the Gore-Glaze lord shouted from below for the defiant sentries to drop the bridge. Finally they complied, only after the governor ordered his men to begin torching his stronghold. The governor had little energy left, so the sentries slipped punishment.

The revolting serfs had now just returned, armed with the blacksmiths creations, and the blacksmith himself tied in a sack. Men were still trying to get inside, being showered left and right by arrows and rocks. They put almost no effort to get in, men falling off the sides of the bridge into the murky depths and drowning. The ocassional powder shot was fired from the mob, missing, but it was loud enough to demoralize. 

Many souls lives were now in the hands of peasantry, as the rebelling serfs were making great strides, the lord having no choice but to leave family to die. As the drawbridge struggled to be raised, the last thing heard was the voice of a soldier, almost inside but crippled. He was only a boy.

As he was being trampled over by the animals that bypassed the lifted drawbridge, his bones being grinded up mash, the lord ordered an archer on the tower to put the kid out of his misery. 

"Put the boy down so he may live a better life!" 

People argued what to do, some of the relatives panicking to try and save the kid from dying. Knights lined up to push them back, before the lord had enough and screamed for captain to play the bugle. More were called to help.

A line of pikemen formed at the entrance to slow the advancement, a priest now giving the blessing fast. The mother with her back turned, sobbing. Women were also shielding their younglings from seeing the horrors, the father of the boy the only relative allowed to watch. He clutched his hands like fists, a straight face the entire time. His father knew his child would die, so the man was strong. Silent as he looked his boy in the eyes. 

"Lest us remember you, champion! And lest us remember Hard-Glaze. The divine shall lift you...." 

The remaining observed as the pikes pulled back, and the gates came crashing down. The father of the boy continued to look at his dying son until he could not. Suddenly there was the sound of a crossbow bolt released, and a gurgling sound replacing horrifying shrieks. The father was relieved of all worry, shutting his eyes. The final siege had only just begun.

Governor Pantis had no objection for a well planned last standing, so he ordered the big boys to kill all reserves from inside with hands, knowing it could falter the advance of a siege for several more days, and keep good blades from becoming bad blades.These defenses would hold good, but starvation was a concern, even for inexperienced powerholders. So Pantis demanded something seeming foolish at first, but in his eyes a fury vengence to wreck sick humanity. 

Two scouts were dismissed from tedious labor inside the fortress, to perform more tedious labor outside the fortress. It was when these two men with speed had acquired more than a scenic overview of corpsed fucklets scattered in outlying ruins, that they ran a even harder one back to inform Pantis of a new upcoming hell razing. 

They were in view of the fortress, and right outside the drawbridge when two tired war steeds galloped into view. These beasts with them the bodies of nude men, attached to the sattles by their broken limbs. Their pale counterpart glazemen had fleshtones impure with a sickening chocolate flavor, like mud, and indeed mud, or the unsweet excrements like the darkhides gone wild. 

In other words, these men tied to steed, they were covered on a disgusting shit that caked their bodies in the hot sun. Surprisingly they survived the journey without eating the shit, and then puking their guts out violently. 

The two scouts slowed in the grazing field to meet the duel steeds now coming into view, but they continued past the scouts outside, all the way to the water defense where these exhausted beasts sipped aggressively the murky fluids, given they would soon die of dehydration from the run.

Pantis sat indoors as this happened, but the trumpets were played from man to man, from the farthest side of the stronghold, to the doors of the Keep. The governor was mapping out the base with his leftover officers, when a knight rushed through the doors unannounced. 

"Two men are here. Survivors." 

"They bring forth words of grace? Or words of disgrace?" 

"Words to kill our race..." 

"Then we bring our boys home, then spite these fools without taste once they besiege our last line." 

"Aye sir!" 

The quartermaster ordered five rambunctous loyal ones (all stupid the darkhides) to walk out into the forest as intended decoy, aside with the corpsed animals dotted in the wilderness. The armies were now in view to the Lord in the tower, but he thought it would be a couple hours before arrival. Pantis could feel the shaking of drum and cannon combined. The defenses were not set just yet, as Pantis thought they had time, but it was clear as day he was wrong.

Right as the darklanders entered the deep treeline and almost were lost, there was the sound of crashing over all the battles in the distance, and the area they marched into was instantly engulfed by a white smoke. Horses on the patty fields were startled by the rupture, and started going crazy. Bugles played without the Lords given word, every man now witnessing the ordeal. Archers started to run to the walls, climbed ladders up, or taking the stairs, where they were preparing their remaining missiles. Lines of men running up where they could, in surprising formation. But was it enough? 

Guns were carried slower up the walls, but they managed. The archers followed up behind a shorter line of gunners by the two left and right defenses, where the bridge sat in between below. These bowmen and repeaters aiming in the sky. The powdershot troopers either using sticks to line up shaky hold, or leaning up against the wall itself with their guns. 

It was then that smoke had begun to sweep through the forests opening, all the way out to the drawbridge an incredible length, gracefully. The five brave the darkhides were evidently sucked into the trap. "Damn that Bumblestomp!" governor Pantis screamed ferociously, and all the darkhides were then heard distinctly in the forest, screaming as they died, the continued cannons heard firing. Pantis was furious, with all of his tricks foiled by a smarter Bumblestomp out of nowhere. The corpsed animals did not deter starving peasants, as he would realize next. 

A soldier skipped steps to the tower where Pantis overlooked in awe. 

"Sir! They're here. They're here! You said it'd be a couple hours until!" 

"Clear as day private, so defend your peoples or witness death! I miscalculated."

"Damn straight!" 

Dozens of sillouttes then showed in the opening, as the closest cloud of smoke dissipated inches by the fort. Of course the lesser souls of peasant status like fodder were sent first. Promised fine coin and ample stomachs full. They started to accumulate in a mass, now an estimated two hundred. They seemed to hesitate after leaving the forests protection, but a horn sent them into a frenzy towards the fortress with pitchforks, some with shorter blades, some with nothing at all. The commanders gave a hand signal on the walls, standing on chairs behind. A drum riff made clear, and the voices mostly similar. "Loose." 

Arrows answered scum, and every skipped archer behind was told to shoot one missile so they could conserve ammo. Some peasants in their farmers outfits, suspenders, as well as cowboy hats had begun to collapse in the front as they charged. These defenders continued routine two more volleys until the senior officer yelled to the other walls through a cone, standing behind his marksmen on a highstool. "Their general is in the back. He's carrying stripes!" 

Troopers acknowledged this sentiment, and the archers were told to aim lower to reach the peasant leader. More volleys ensued, and finally the mob was wiped out and the stragglers running for their lives. The peasant master dead under his own in the field. 

A second smoke appeared far off to the right, the mens celebrations dead.

Muskets quickly angled to the source in their positions. The cloud remained longer this time, a group of four shorties seen coming out to entertain the attack. 

"That's all?" 

They appeared weak, in civilian outfits, but this time they were smarter, all four men brandishing large serpentines, fearlessly aiming barrels ahead, before blasting fireballs in the defenders positions. Semi-automatic in clear synchronization. Long streams of fire carried bombs over in response, all guns going off louder than any Bronze Glaze siege shot. Fast like bullets, one of the bombs landed spot on, creating a spectacular display of pink mist and dirt pick up, killing useful muskets. One bomb landing short outside, and the last one slamming into the side of a wall, shaking the foundations center. 

Men were told not to fire their guns, but several violated and spent their precious balls in panic. One senior officer fell off his stool nearby, a quake knocking him down. Enraged and sweating profusely, he got back up, torn ceremonial cloth, and limped over to beat the stupids with the steel on a pistol, first firing his only round point-blank in a traitors kneecap. The fools had never seen their master swear so much in life, and being shot was a 'no go,' so they sharpened up and stopped wasting their missiles. They hit nothing when firing their powder, the four cannon boys already running back into their smokescreen with heavy contraptions. Was this the end?

Spooning is an Italian torture execution method invented solely for the deaths of the Unenlightened Fucklets.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Description</b></font>

For one to be spooned, you must remove their clothing and firmly strap them into your position of choosing. The victim will be slouched downward, its ass-cheeks firmly opened, revealing the depths. You must stuff said spoon into the victims chocolate inventory, removing all of its contents. Start by penetrating through the rectum, inserting an opposite route, then plunging it deep further. Once you scoop out a creamy, sticky substance, start scooping slower to increase pain. Continue scooping until the 'canal' is fully breached, then sit back, and enjoy the sights of the victim being drained.

The Ride of Tears is among the most shameful ways to die in the Hard-Glazed society, more-so than spooning. Those executed on the Ride of Tears are normally murderers, those accused of adultery, and white-hide newborns with visible genetic defects. Indeed, similar to spooning, those executed on the Ride of Tears lose all hierarchical status and all their heirs are nullified if they are of formerly noble stature. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Contraption</b></font>

The Ride of Tears consists of an extra-tall water-slide, standing at approximately twenty-five feet tall. It is three feet wide and about thirty feet long. The water-slide, however, is filled to the brim with razorblades and other sharp blades, beginning at about the four-foot mark on the way down. Those condemned to die have their hands tied, are blindfolded, drenched with honey to lubricate them, and forced down the slide by two powderboys, each armed with a pike. If the condemned is still alive by the time he reaches the bottom, at which point he will have likely lost several limbs and all of the skin on his back, several nearby beekeepers will let their bees loose upon him, to feast upon the honey and his flesh. After the condemned is expired, they are transported to the Iron Gate of Glaze to be displayed outside, for the doors have not opened in centuries.

The Perpetual Urges started off as a bypass to the Fourth Erotica Ban (22) dictating anything sexually stimulating in the form of literature to be outlawed. Instead, Boxer "H." Krammy described the Perpetual Urges as a "rather funny drama, a sit-back for those of noble stature," denying the claims of it being a erotic form of literature. Lord Maximus ordered Boxer "H." Krammy to be executed in the form of Spooning, for his laws against the F.E.B. Despite its obvious bypass, the Perpetual Urges still remains un-banned, and free for all those of white hides.

The Glaze is the light.. it is the truth - you cannot see it in perspective as it is you; your foolishness, greatness, your power.. Submission is the only option, as the body you govern is no longer of your power, as it is the Glaze sparing you of your own freedoms. Perpetual indelicacies - it is a fragile fragment of the greatest power of all - the Holy Hierachy. Follow the light and the darkness, as there is no difference - you are just another piece of the Lord's Hierachy. 

Historians believe that it was in The Age of Enlightenment, where The Glaze was made familiar to the people.. It came out from the abyss, as one central governing system... The Hard-Glaze, from there on, used The Glaze as a method of conversion of the peoples to their main belief -- The Glaze.. The Glaze was truly a powerful blow to the belief systems of the time... The Glaze had shown that times were different, that the grand High Council of the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios.. These powerful beings could take over the world and make it... an intellectually bound center for all races, all systems of government.. But it was in a more in-depth acknowledgement.

<i>"I simply obey the rules of Glaze in either contemporary or of preceding state. It was knowledge to many that state-of-the-art, hot off the press designs such as these have such craftsmanship, mastery and adeptness crafted into each and every Death Ship I have been accustomed to document wholesomely.

—Dobby C. Soljian, statesman of the recent rennouned Hard-Glaze naval Meritime Museum, poet and novelist. 

In the dark near-by remoteness of the river basin, lies the many of sailors in servitude with their commanding officer. The heart of the rivers and oceans in the world are strictly forbidden for darkhides and amish alike, leaving one dictator in which he rules over the sovereignty of many nations in the midst of the worlds changes today, time and time again. He is Lord Maximus, and he is also the commander of the royal navy's greatest ever display of Death Ships. Black and drifting aimlessly as locked in port, these ferocious warriors above their Death Ships go by the common nickname of the Blagoonie Sailor Sweets. This name stems from Booby Blagoona's recorded sneak into one of these vastly superior Death Ships, without documentation, without purpose it would seem, but many knew in the aftermath that he did it for one reason, to exploit the greatest nation on Earth. God bless his nasty soul. These whaling ships are guarded by some of the most elite protection leagues under Hard-Glaze legislature and authorities. Multi-plated and covered in a final layer of chain-mail just below parts of the rudder and haul, these disturbingly secure Death Ships, as called by Hard-Glaze politicians and figures of importance, have displayed some of the greatest achievements of all time in naval history, sinking a column of darkhide fishing vessels off the strait of Madagascar in April of Holy Hierarchy.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The First Sightings & Confrontation</b></font>

It was said on the day of April, late era of Holy Hierarchy, that these immense ships were first spotted off the coast of Madagascar, and from there their highest commanding officer of the navy and royal estates -- Lord Maximus, stood atop the vessals quarter deck, just below the main sail, as he protruded out over the railing as the waves and low currents settled around the top commanding Death Ship in the Hard-Glaze armada. "Ahoy, we've made it alas!" -- Lord Maximus' first words of rejoice, as he and his superior officers made landfall onto the coast of Madagascar. "Alas, bring me two men to the crows nest, and prepare me a meal from the galley..." But soon enough, the entire fleet in its formation encountered a rather intimidating foe around the rocky cliffs of the coast. It was a darkhide fishing vessal, and beyond that, many more of them in a collisal line, swiftly maneuvering into the direction of the setting sun so that they could aim starboard side their smaller barrel cannons at the Hard-Glaze armada, as it clearly lacked the readiness to dispense ammunitions back if to be attacked by the darkhide fleet, moving in a forward line. The top officer, below the stature of Lord Maximus, ordered a sailor man to ride the bowsprit of the boat, and gaze his binoculars in direction to the incoming fleet that would be turning its guns in direction of Lord Maximus' ship infront of every other vessal. This course of action left the sailor with his life lost in the depths of the sea, as a response to this was the darkhides and their stolen cannons, discharging the first shots that ignited conflict. As one might imagine, the warm waters would prove a manageable one for this sailor to remain in the depths for a little longer than frigid waters, but no. He was without delay, smashed by the frontal portion of Lord Maximus and his ship, leaving the sailor as the first casualty of Hard-Glaze and the Death Ships. 
]]

Book_Deathships_Page3 = [[
With little time to spare, Lord Maximus and his entire armada was ordered to line up, and begin their starboard side engagement. The first five minutes were crucial, and this meant that everything had to be timed perfectly -- And it indeed was. All ships lined up, one to the next, and began to fire their first warning shots at the darkhide fishing fleet, and just as the first shots were directed in the waters aside the darkhides and their boats, these savage fucklets started their policy of total destruction, sinking the first Deathship right next to Lord Maximus' frigate. "All men to the starboard side, prepare to engage these disgusting dark-hide peasants with everything you got, fire all cannons!" and so the men moved to their positions on every ship, all ships giving the same order. Every warship in the Hard-Glaze fleet began their circling maneuvers in direction to the attackers aboard their pretty ships, there were a total of six ships in attacking distance - Lord Maximus controlling one of them, so three ships broke up from the armada and began their maneuvering procedure. Three ships going left, three ships going right, and so this began the onslaught of the darkhides and their fishing boats in the Madagascar strait. All Death Ships equipped with hot oil, and even Lord Maximus' frigate armed with a recreation of the Leonardo da Vinci Triple Barrel Cannon invention, using that instinctively to bombard the hell out of incoming darkhide ships as the ship began its tactical pursuit. These were the first tactical orders of the commander and his fleet in Hard-Glaze name, moving the six ships, all in different directions to surround the darkhides and their attempted slaughter of noblemen aboard Hard-Glaze Death Ships. 
]]

Book_Deathships_Page4 = [[
As Lord Maximus' frigate and other surrounding Death Ships managed to pin the darkhide floaters in the middle, it was then that a top ranked official ordered every ship to begin the ultimatum, exposing a pure red flag above the main frigates main topmast, indicating the firing of all starboard sides in addition to the new prototype weapons that latched to each forecastle deck, able to make a full 360 degree turn in their very technologically advanced state, all aboard these devastating Death Ships. These new prototypes were called the 33 Barreled Organ Guns, and they proved their point by destroying at least five darkhide ships in one volley, all guns firing simultaneously. Just as the flag was lowered to pronounce the death of many darkhide ships, another top ranked official in the commanding frigate ordered an oil exposure, each corresponding ship expelling its nutrients of blazing hot oil over the fishermen that fell into the depths. The oil quickly stuck to each enemy of the state, burning them to a roast despite being in the water.

Soon after the elites of Hard-Glaze military action let loose their hell barrage on the fishing vessals, another near-by armada had arrived after receiving an S.O.S signal from the controlling frigate, beginning their barrage on the rest of the retreating fleet with Special Class Battle Barges, each armed to the bone with many cannons on every side of it, much like a pillbox. These floating machines of war created a hailstorm of fire, and left the smell of blood in the air after leaving nothing but decimation in their holy name. The aftermath was nothing more but a display of Hard-Glaze superiority in warm darkhide waters. Ultimately it showed truly the might of a nation advanced and clearly growing more and more powerful by the years. The Hard-Glaze commanders at the first naval engagement in Holy Hierarchy gave the land-based darkhides a chance to fish out their corpsed women and children who were aboard the fishing fleet of darkhide servitude. It was a disgusting sight for sore eyes, one would simply only agree to. As one Hard-Glaze commander said during the aftermath of the bloody engagement, with only one Death Ship destroyed and all one-hundred and twenty of its crew killed in the strait, "It was horrible. The corpses were of dark-hide compound, but many were also whites. It's a shame the Powder Boys only arrived late to the party to ruin such darkhides in their fleet of intolerance!"

Other officers spoke to the press of what had occurred in the strait of Madagascar, but only in small, broken up words as they too, were devastated by the conflict of losing merely one and simply one ship. This backed up the point that these Death Ships carried some of the elites of Hard-Glaze nobility and highly trained sailors, so it was known for devastation to be felt after the casualty count came through. 

<i>"We have a ruination in our ... 

... midst, the waste of good nobles ... 

... and sailors alike, such a pity ... 

... that they too were washed in the ... 

... waters of darkhide, only after ... 

... pledging to conquer such ... 

... intolerable scum." </i>

And so the day folded over, and the scum of darkhide failed ever again to decimate another Death Ship into the modern period. God bless for that prophecy to be fulfilled.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Precursor</b></font>

When Fucker Joe, A.K.A Joseph A. Philadelphus, who was known as a Hard-Glaze genocidal killer ravaged the rural area in the Province of Louisiana, kidnapping over 150 women and killing them all, the killer fixated his eyes on a new target of interest. It was the Governors Plantation in Louisiana, commonly referred by commanding leaders in council meetings as Farmstead 8, or Castle 8. A heavily fortified plantation with a castle established on top of a hill. This well-defended area was Fucker Joe's interest, and he wanted so dearly to plot terrible things against the Glazic Union and strike them deep and hard. So he prepared a week-long annihilation idea of his, to attack mobile, in his vehicle and blaze the crops and all of the inhabitants with a machine gun mounted to it. This was no ordinary plot, he went into full depth with it, deciding what to do in the event he were caught. He had suicide pills, explosive grenades, Molotov Cocktails, handcuffs, and other various tools to attack with. Fucker Joe decided he would use the handcuffs to subdue the Governor and interrogate/torture him in his very own fortified Mansion on top of the hill, while using ducktape to strap make-shift explosives to various places, giving him an advantage, and then he would toss grenades from his windows while in motion as he made his escape from the burning farm. It was an elaborate plot it seemed, but for the Governor, he knew that Fucker Joe was coming. He had a prediction the night prior to the attack. 

A 'vision' one would consider, but experts concluded that it could have been a hallucination after taking various drugs in his mansion the following night, and in addition to having intense orgies with many clients and mistresses, which may have lead it up to be a mere coincidence. The vision was said to have sparked a new era of alert mentality for governors all mingled, as the governor simply put in his personal agenda papers the night the vision occurred in his mind. The man behind the ink pen wrote and recorded the finest vision ever produced by a Governor in a smaller township region, rumoring the demise of himself and his high-ranking officials as he saw in his horrible vision, though merely as sacrifice to Hard-Glaze and death as honorable as possible with a flowerbed to be pronounced at his funeral.

Other recited words in the letter told the many baffled leaders in the Capitol District far away, that the governor himself would be "so consumed by the smell of smoldering black hides", regardless of the fact they were purchased in his name, so that they could work in his farm. The Governors name was Tom 'Albert' Roberto, a man of Hispanic background with roots deep in the Spanish colonization of the darkhide lands. He was a ferocious warrior, with atleast ten or more gold medals of certification for his success in many fronts. 

He took on the Amish during the beginning days of Holy Hierarchy Wars, decimating them first, and then tackling the darkhides and even the proclaimed Redneck Allegence Party, proposing Lord Maximus with his trusty hand in combat. Of course after all of these situations, Lord Maximus took note of this well-played master of chess, purchased a White Steed representing the Philimonjio and his journey to control all dark hides east of the Hard-Glaze lands during Holy Hierarchy, and then offered it as a token of gratitude for Alberto. A gift it seemed. It was a brutal display of honorary status for Alberto, at least in the eyes of the darkhides. Though it was truly remarkable to see him and his armor-clad horse riding into combat, blazing hordes of darkhides as they ran from the battlefield. Indeed Alberto was a man to be worshipped by Hard-Glaze predecessors, riding as a shining example of enlightenment in Hard-Glaze name. Beauty inside, much like Blagoona's speeches, but on a sincere Hard-Glaze level. It was reported that Alberto had a fine acquired taste for things 'bling' in their natural element. He desired products that were shipped far and few to the Hard-Glaze capital, where he would prance much like a darkhide in applause to what had just purified him -- The liquor he desired so much, which in coincidence to Fucker Joe's soon-to-be ravaging of a liquor house in a town not so far from where the action would occur.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Event that Shook The Province of Louisiana. </b></font>

It was the following morning that Fucker Joe began his demonic pursuit for destruction on a national level, all that would inevitably hit Glazic news stations around the Province of Louisiana. As remembered by several eye-witnesses, they all reportedly saw Fucker Joe enter a small township two miles outside the road of notorious Castle 8, where he picked up a plentiful amount of alcoholic beverages to consume while he inflicted sickening slaughter on weaklings..

Joe knew he would have to blast his way through the beverage store in order to obtain his liquor, and that he indeed did, leaving entrails behind the counter where the man was mercilessly fucked beyond repair in his own business. 

Hours later would be remarkably one of the most disgusting acts of war on Hard-Glaze by a third-party member, the Fucker Joe... His ruthless behavior leaving a scar on the Glazic stature entirely, gifting many nationally titled politicians of Glaze to call him out as a coward in their own words. It was said that during the following morning, after blasting his way into a liquor store to obtain his precious substance, he started up the engine to his vehicle and prepared to ride gloriously into the farmstead of Castle 8, where he would ultimately shoot up more innocent bystanders, and so he did that, in fact. The minute drive left nobody time to escape the demise. Commentators of the farmstead speak in words frightening to many, telling a tale unlike no other. It was said as the engine was heard like a howling wind in the distance, a siren started to blare from the Castles alert system. 
]]

Book_Assault_Page4 = [[
This old fashioned device was still in use from years prior, but served its purpose well. The combination of sirens going off and the engine howling left people emotionally scarred. Darkhides and china men from all directions took off from their stations, most of them unable to escape but some proven lucky to break the binds of metal around their limbs. Many of these workers, darkhides and china men combined were chained to their legs, unable to fend for themselves, as the engine became increasingly louder... and that soon resolved with the death sounds in the distance too. "Attention, attention... We have a predicament in our midst," the audio man spoke out, it was the governor Alberto, attempting to ensure everyone's safety was secure.... clearly it was not, as people were mowed down upon the vehicles breach of the outer gates to the facility. Many darkhides towards the front stretch were shot down by the heavy-caliber vehicle strap-on, the entire car shaking unsteadily in its own machinery turbulence, leaving at least more of the workers towards the back of the field to attempt to escape unscathed... too bad they didn't survive. 

Atleast five dozen workers were initially brought down by the onslaught at the gate, as the rolling wheels continued down dirt paths and into the very beautiful cobble-stone that marked the beginning of the Castle. Molotov Cocktails were seen being tossed wrecklessly from each side window, as the wheels then caught on fire from the method mans very own cocktails that fell too short, some however reaching their targets and blackening darkhides into a darker breed it seemed. Then came the grenade volleys.. It seemed as though hundreds of these tiny explosive grenades started being tossed out of the windows in a variety of ways -- Some of the grenades clearly inside garbage bags to maximize devastation on the workers. Limbs fried like chicken in the breeze, bodies strewned across the dirt and cobble-stone, and not a security official able to weaken the masters defenses. More reports came in from the on-ground witnesses, telling more of the story as the muscle car drove up the hill where the castle was positioned.

Book_Assault_Page5 = [[
"Get the f-fucking rifle, Johnny!" -- The words of Alberto to his personal security guard, the man besides Alberto named Johnny scrambling quickly to toss him a beer-keg barrel that contained the goodies, then kicking the sucker over onto the floor where the Governor resumes to load many loose single bullets into a magazine of his rifle -- A considerably drawn-out process that left the fate of the Castle in both of their hands. The Governor then threw his full body weight against the balcony door to his bedroom, smashing it down with his fat obnoxious body, stepped out onto the top balcony of his bedroom window, where he took a glimpse of all of his profits being thrown down the drain, or in other words, thrown in the air to burn. He aimed down the sights and unleashed a full magazine of Holopoint tracer rounds in direction to the oncoming Muscle Car, both of them serious now, but the muscle car clearly not stopping at this point. The Governor then watched in awe as the muscle car drove away and rolled quickly outside of the fortified Castle Plantation from the side entrance, leaving dust in every face, and never to be seen again by Alberto or his crew. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Aftermath & The Scorched Earth Policy</b></font>

It was said that in the aftermath of the attack of Fucker Joe on Alberto's precious cargo of darklings and china men, half-consumed liquor bottles and blood all tainted the land and prevented further occupation and work. It took weeks after the attack for things to be considered "normal" again for Alberto and his crew, and although much of the prophecies that Alberto envisioned never occurred, the one that in fact did stick in his mind for the rest of his life, was the original vision of his plantation being assaulted. As one responsible Glazic commander would order, the Scorched Earth Policies came after the outbreak of Fucker Joe, in response to what he performed on Alberto's precious cargo. Said to have been one of the biggest epidemics in Glazic history, beside the clear obvious one of darkhides, the retardation and drunkards that consume so much alcohol per household is surely to be locked on the charts for future priority-makers in the Capital region today.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Karmine Willtan </b></font>

<i>"I've not a man nor a prophet. Simply an inferno."</i>
—Karmine Willtan - When asked if he was man or god by a serf.

Karmine Willtan (b. 4E), is a Minister of Glazic Faith. His works are well known across the entirety of the Hierarchy, as his teachings led to the building of the Faith Ministry, the replacement of the inferior Royal Pope system. Willtan is said to be the first man, born as a peasant, to rise to the Small Senate due to his political cunning. Even more admirable was his efforts to root out the spread of the Goreic Faith, a puppet religion system designed by the Fucklets of the county districts. 

Many wonder if Willtan was once a firm believer of the Goreic Faith before his time served on the Small Senate, due to his high level of knowledge about the nature of the Goreic Faith itself. Philosophers explained his wide level of knowledge of all topics, including those with controversial themes. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Early Life</b></font>

Karmine Willtan was believed to be born a peasant of a different name. His life consisted of heavy labor, working side by side with the Black Hides as he was believed to be of Slavic and Hispanic descent. This, of course, was confirmed to be a slanderous lie as later testing proved him to be a Philimonjio Superior. Willtan, though not renowned as a poet, produced various sonnets describing his laborious stay in the county districts alongside the darkhides. The sonnets documented his struggles, including the time a dark hide had stolen his grapefruit, forcing him to retrieve the grapefruit from the darkling's swollen anus. 
]]

Book_Karmine_Page2 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Rise to Power </b></font>

It is still up to speculation on how Karmine Willtan received the knowledge necessary to become a spreader of the Glaze. To be born a peasant and exhibit vast wisdom is indeed a rare thing. Willtan himself refused to comment on how he gained such information, stating that "I was born in darkness, but then I saw the light. Nothing more." Lord Maximus himself hand-picked Willtan to replace the previous Minister of Faith, who was executed by crucifixion for suspicion of malicious intent upon the Council Pedestal. Karmine Willtan accepted the offer, and was transported to the Palace of the Small Senate. His first years on the Senate were indeed hard ones, as the noblemen refused to accept him in for his lack of true noble blood. In a legendary show of fervor, Willtan retrieved a dagger which he used to cut his arm, drawing blood as he exclaimed, "Is my skin not white like Sol, and is my blood not red like its glaze?" From then on he was acknowledged, but it will be many years before he will be truly accepted as an equal, if at all. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Goreic Purges</b></font>

When delivering a speech upon the current state of the Council Pedestal and the Hierarchy itself, a dark hide interrupted the scene and hefted a heavy stone at Karmine Willtan. Due to its inferior genetics, the darkling missed its aim, hitting another man in the crowd. Before being shot down by guardsmen, the darkling yelled out "Death to the Glaze and rise to the Gay Gore!" Willtan took note of this, as the entire rest of the day he was reported to be very distressed, running down the halls of the palace, banging his head against the walls and throwing pots and pans and silverware across the corridors. 
]]

Book_Karmine_Page3 = [[
Finally, when his anger subsided, he rallied a peasant folk militia to march into the county district, aided by various paramilitary forces, including the famous Powderboys, influenced by coffers. What came next remains controversial, as many small capital companies were devastated by lack of laborers due to the mass slaughterings that happened in their districts. Willtan refrained from doing an all-out massacre, and instead occupied the districts with his forces, ending the problem by its roots and not by the stem. A famous and ingenious act occurred when Karmine began a public preach of the Goreic Faith, posing as a Goreic Minister. This, of course, served as a spotlight that attracted all Goreic believers like moths to a light. When his speech concluded, the Powderboys, poised in machine gun towers, began spraying down on all those who attended the preaching, leaving none alive, as Karmine witnessed the glory firsthand.  

The slaughterings began shortly afterwards, burning down shantytowns and small villages as the Faithmen ravaged the county districts, the same ones where Karmine Willtan himself was born. The same darkling who stole Willtan's grapefruit in his early years was identified and brought forth to Willtan, who executed him with a gold-plated .44 Magnum, after stating the words "Look at you now, your head is nothing but pink mist." The total death count was comparable to the Reductions of the Fourth Era, but due to how long and spread out the massacres were, historians refuse to accept this act as an Official Genocide.

— Lord Maximus XII, beginning his march on the black-hide tribes. 

On the silver saddle piece, it shows a carving of a darkhide trademark symbol, and a watermelon in the glove of the administrator, as he stands on his pedestal. 

He wears the glove to give off the symbolism that he cannot stand the grotesque values of the darkhide backbone.Therefore, he uses their simple darkhide mind as a tool to his regime. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Origins</b></font>

It was the beginning of the time for one to decide the fate of the world. His name was Lord 'Henry-Harrison' Maximus, a brilliant scholar of magic and talents. His name stemmed from the royal heritage. It was a brilliant time for him to decide the fate of many darkhides in the region he knew best. It was a time of tribal justice, but he knew that there were alternatives involved. The darkhide grew restless, and with that, came the possibility of war. It was real to Lord Maximus, it was no-longer child's play. It was outright war. And with war, came genocide. And with genocide, came coffers drained. And with that, was death and finality. He aged from the royalty as a man of golden status. He was truly the brightest of the bunch, raised out from a family of two parents with five other bred children. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page2 = [[
Many knew that it was time for Maximus to move on in the world, and so he did. Financially he was set, but intellectually he was staggering. He had to obtain knowledge from key resources throughout the land. And so he did, without tribulation.

The unruly hide would take years, even decades for one to finally convince this flaming beast otherwise. It was a meek understanding by those who were apart of it, that this creature of fire would decay the world forever. The objectives were certain in this notion: Destroy the darkhide in means to save the world. And did they not destroy the darkhide? Yes, they in-fact did. Today is a living example that of. Nevertheless, the alertness of the darkhide gave understanding to Lord Maximus (Or should I say, Maximus the Great, as many called him when face-to-face.)  

"Vigilance is key to the worlds survival", as Maximus the Great told others countless times in his journey to the top. "Discretion is key", He would also say, during countless meetings around the world. This man of golden status was not only the scholar we knew of in his time, but surely a god. A god with arms, limbs, and a head on his shoulders.  

The year was of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, when the darkhide had grew stronger, and strong enough to raise hell on the landscape. Cities burned, crumbling to the ground. People gave up. They turned towards any religious artifacts they had, and prayed with those artifacts that one day this hell on earth would end.

Book_Maximus_Page3 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Age of Innocence</b></font>

The age of innocence, as some would have called it. They were the days of agitation for Lord Maximus. A common pre-conceived notion of Lord Maximus, is that he was lived the life of glory. But what's commonly mistaken for those to see, is that he was not glorious during his 'earlier' years, but in-fact innocent. This personal believe or judgement, has lead Lord Maximus to the brink of destroying his own people. And with that, comes the possibility of never giving the darkhide the receiving side of things. Lord Maximus' childhood was a violent one, a noisy one. A commotion indeed as many would agree to these words. There was anxiety, restlessness, and an overall sense of insecurity amongst the royal family. The man that raised Maximus, for starters, was a drunkard. A disgusting wench of a man that somehow obtained royal status many years before. It was the riots in the east that lead Maximus to  believe, HIS father is the responsibility for all of this.

And yes Maximus, a thinker at the time, was correct. It was the rebellions during Lord Maximus' childhood that gave him a bitter impression of his father. And with that, he carried with him for the rest of his life as royal successor to the throne. 

This age of innocence was surely a huge misconstrued outbreak in Lord Maximus' life.      

Willian-Henry Maximus had a choice to decipher what this all meant, or continue to ignore it as he did at some points in his time. All would render him confused and outright angry and disorderly. But sure enough, there was a translation years later, with the arrival of John Stegmore, a political analyst of the time before Lord Maximus rose to the throne during the years of reconstruction of Hard Glaze.      
]]

Book_Maximus_Page4 = [[
But then, as the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios grew and prospered, there came a threat from the north.

Long before the time of Lord Maximus and the Glaze, there grew a civilization in ancient America known as the black-hats. But as the clouds of radiation set in, the black-hats became something extraordinarily evil. Gone were their formerly pacificst ways. Before long, all knew to fear the sight of a chariot.      

However, at the time, both Lord Maximus and his contemporaries knew something was amiss. For several months, there had been many black-hat incursions into Hard-Glazed territory. Reports from the north flooded into the capital district, of mutant men in robes and tall hats attacking villages, butchering the populace, and feasting upon the livestock.      

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Campaigns & Expansion</b></font>

Lord Maximus would not stand for the treachery taking place in his northern provinces. He swiftly sent for his top generals, and devised a plan. He would levy the peasants of the northern provinces to attack black-hat caravans in overwhelming numbers, while his main army pillaged and razed their towns, ensuring their total destruction. After a conflict (known today as the Amish wars) lasting only a few mere months, the black-hats were completely eradicated.

With his northern border secure and new lands acquired, Lord Maximus set his sights west, to the coast occupied by independent Glazic fanatics. After quickly overrunning the scattered rabble, Lord Maximus had increased the size of his empire almost twofold. 

However, the looming threat, and most dangerous of all, were the hundreds of black-hide tribes to the east. 

After launching an assault and enslaving or killing the entirety of fifty darkhide tribes, Lord Maximus was repulsed at the Battle of the Province of Louisiana. With this crushing defeat, Lord Maximus tactically retreated to the border of the province, fortifying the entire border with a wall of howitzers and other arms, both large and small, whilst he made plans for his next assault. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>The Wars of the Holy Hierarchy</b></font>

Expansions came early in the wars of Holy Hierarchy. It was a storm of vigilance on the darkhide populace. A fury frenzy of gold-plated soldiers racing their feet to break into darkhide compounds that fell to the tribes. It wasn't the unusual for a darkhide army to fling piles of fecal matter at the retreating Hard-Glaze soldiers within distance to them. Orgies of darkhide soldiers would confiscate the lands treasures and then either throw them in a corner of the compound, or simply hold on to these treasures for no understanding at all. darkhides of the more harmonious types, would be reluctant to melt down these treasures for profit. But not all darkhides thought that way, and as a result, many decided to ill-mindedly throw these treasures away rather than doing the deed for profits. Valued silvers, gems, crystals, and other corresponding items of ceremonial use were taken to the darkhide homeland. It would seem as though these possessions of monetary value were simply ditched. The darkhide had no idea in his mind, how to profit from any of it.

It was during the later years of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, that all of the pandemonium died down, in what seemed to be a truce of sorts. This time of piece was also a time of great growth in population. When all mayhem seemed to burn away in the midst of the Holy Hierarchy Wars, the neutrality came clear. This time frame of the conquest era was named 'The darkhide Pacification' which seemed to do just that. Though not exactly a treaty, it was more of an agreement to put down all arms and discontinue all military campaigns for a brief period to calm down. The coffers that were drained no-longer continued to be drained. The average death stopped as well. 

But then, the bombs began to fall. Entire cities were erased by the scourge of the Glaze. Both sides were drawn into a total war, in which neither would stop fighting until the other had been completely erased. This unprecedented conflict claimed billions of lives, and nearly caused the collapse of society back to primal levels, were it not for Lord Maximus' divine intervention. 

Not much is known about the late years of the Holy Hierarchy, but what is known is that the Hard-Glazed Phillimonjios prevailed in the face of insurmountable odds, due the efforts of Lord Maximus in preserving the Glazic union. Indeed, many cities were reduced to ash, but in the aftermath of this Pyrrhic victory, the Glaze reigned supreme. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Post-Holy Hierarchy Wars</b></font>

In the aftermath of the apocalyptic Holy Hierarchy Wars, Lord Maximus' empire was reduced to rubble and dirt. However, despite the destruction of pre-established cities, the territory under his control had tripled, as all darkhide tribes in the known world had been exterminated (during the Cleansing of Unruly Dark Hide). The Inquisition, which ensured that every black-hide not in submission was destroyed, now found itself without purpose. And so, in a demonstration of his noble stature, Lord Maximus granted all former Inquisition members vast estates in a show of generosity. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page7 = [[
However, upon finding out that the Inquisition (which in their opinion did not contribute to total victory) were being so generously rewarding for their invaluable service by Lord Maximus, the Glazic Armed Forces revolted. Over 250,000 well-armed men besieged District 1, in the largest siege known to mankind to date. The capital's walls and infrastructure were still weak from the sackings of the Holy Hierarchy, but the Maximilian Guard (who bear the Lord's name), staunchly defended it. Lord Maximus knew he could count on his force of expertly trained, steadfast, and most importantly fanatically loyal elites, but they were outnumbered five to one. 

The capital, District 1, was far too large for the 250,000 man force to encircle, and so they set up 9 camps around the city. In the case of a breakout attempt, there would always be reinforcements from both sides. The troops elected their ringleader and General Booby A. Harvington (not to be confused with Booby Blagoona) as the new emperor, directly challenging Lord Maximus' right to the Diamond Throne. They devised a plan. The troops would wait until the population of District 1 began to revolt due to pestilence and famine, and then would use the distraction to assault. In the meantime, they would prepare siege engines for their assault. 

Meanwhile, Lord Maximus had not been idle inside the city walls. Delivering many a speech, he rallied public support and established new farms inside the ruins of the Royal Senate grounds, which encompassed over a sixth of the city. Even though the aqueducts and sewers had been shelled by the apostates, disease did not break out. The siege lasted for six months. Because of these factors, the deserters began to become impatient.

<b>The First Assault</b>

Pressured by his officers and nearly-mutinous troops, General Booby began preparations for the final assault. Several obstacles stood in his way. The main bridge leading into the city, and most importantly, to the symbolic Iron Gate of Glaze, was extremely well defended. The General ordered his artillery to fire on the defenders, with limited success, but ceased firing to prevent the bridge's destruction. The General then ordered his elite shock troops, veterans of Lord Maximus' conquests of the Black-Hides to advance across the bridge. Covered by General Booby's best crossbowmen, the elite swordsmen crossed the bridge slowly. The defending force, a contingent of about five hundred Maximilian Guard, did not back down against the force of five thousand advancing upon them. Volleys of crossbow fire rained down on the defenders, but did little damage due to the defender's superior armor and shields. Meanwhile, across the city, the secondary force of over 80,000 regulars began advancing to the walls with massive siege towers pulled by mules. Boxer H. Krammy describes what happened next in his Glazica Historica: 

<i>"At sunrise, the six-story siege towers which had been immobile for weeks began advancing across the plains on the south side of the capital. Lord Maximus happened to be on the southern walls at this time. The Glazic gunners took note of the siege towers being pulled by mules, rather than conventionally pushed from behind. Lord Maximus shouted with his thunderous voice "Give them the steel", and so, the steel was given."</i>
—Boxer H. Krammy - Glazica Historica 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page8 = [[
The mules were promptly gunned down by Lord Maximus' dragoons, who fired the Glazic Blunderbuss, to great effect. With the south walls momentarily secure, Lord Maximus rode by horseback to the North, where the elites of both were engaged in combat. During his ride, Lord Maximus was met by many civilians who threw themselves at his horse's feet and praised his divinity. Arriving at the Iron Gate of Glaze, where the skeletal remains of the Royal Senate still hung, Lord Maximus found his guard in a precarious situation. There were only a hundred defenders left out of the original five hundred Maximilian Guard. 

<b>A Time of Reckoning</b>

Determined to turn the tide of the battle, Lord Maximus summoned his closest advisors to the towers above the Iron Gate. Proclaiming that he still had tricks up his sleeve, Maximus announced his intention to hold the bridge at all costs. Meanwhile, the defenders were being reduced one-by-one from the onslaught of swordsmen and crossbow bolts. Suddenly, from over the tops of the walls, masses of darklinges, clad in white powder and with sharpened sticks, began spilling out. During the months under siege, Lord Maximus had bestowed upon his massive slave population the honor of becoming white. The powder-clad warriors had their senses overloaded from their new-found power, and became fanatically loyal to the divine Maximus. Lord Maximus Powderboys were unleashed, and in Lord Maximus own words, "A time of reckoning has come". 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page9 = [[
Over the heads of their comrades they leapt, and began a slaughter of the heretical swordsmen. A mass rout began after over a thousand of General Booby's best men died in a minute or less. Mirroring Lord Maximus' actions at the Battle of the Province of Louisiana, General Booby ordered his artillery to fire on his own men, to destroy the immensely powerful Powderboys. However, the Powderboys were too fast in cutting down the General's men, and began sprinting towards his artillery, with nothing but victory on their minds. Still, over the walls more came like an endless wave. In a turn of events that would glorify the Powderboys for centuries to come, they murdered over 100,000 men in a mere half an hour. 

On the south end, the heretics were taking fire from the Glazic gunners, and had began shelling back with cannons that were previously out of range to make room for the siege towers. The Powderboys circled around the city in both directions, murdering every single man in the camps surrounding the city. However, the Powderboys were momentarily stalled when their darkhide senses began to overpower their new white pride, and they began sacking the camps instead of advancing. This proved almost fatal for Lord Maximus, as the south walls came crashing down under the combined barrage of hundreds of guns. Lord Maximus reminded the Powderboys that there would be time to loot once the battle was over, and that if they lost there would be none. 

Motivated once more, the Powderboys completed the encirclement, and advanced into the heretics' rear as they were attempting to spill into the city (but blocked by Lord Maximus' pikes). General Booby's position was eventually overrun, and he was brought back to Lord Maximus alive by his orders. Following his capture, Booby would endure 40 years of constant torture before finally succumbing to his 38th spooning.

<i>"You speak so highly as to consider yourself a darkhide tributary? Then if God wills it, give this man his honorable celebration. Vile thing, remember these words! Corpse the darkhide, but do not corpse the Philimonjio, for he is spiritual and his integrity is leveled to that of the God that speaks to us in the skies."</i>
—Lord Maximus XII, speaking to the last holdout of darkling solitude. 

After the eventful conclusion of the wars of the Holy Hierarchy, Lord Maximus had consolidated his power. With his mutinous army subdued and the black-hide all but eradicated, with the remnants under control, Lord Maximus could again look forward to an age of peace and prosperity. However, this was not to be the case, as several controversies would stand in his way, the first being the most devastating to Lord Maximus' image. 

Enter Booby Blagoona, an immigrant darkhide of above average intelligence and a charisma likened to that of Lord Maximus himself. Some sources say that Booby managed to sneak aboard one of the Glazic Empire's infamous Death Ships, waiting in the cargo hold for many days before arriving on the American coast. Booby eventually made his way to District 1, an act likely only feasible because of the attention the infamous mass murderer Fucker Joe drew from the Glazic Guard at the time. 
]]

Book_Maximus_Page11 = [[
Reportedly, Booby was able to secure a honorary white-hide passport from a sympathetic provincial governor (who has since been executed), and as such was able to gain access to District 1 on a false-pretext of inquisitional duties. Once inside, he began a mass campaign for equality on a scale not seen since pre-Glazic times. Booby's speeches in the Royal Square even captivated Lord Maximus, who enjoyed the speeches not for their content but for Booby's eloquence. However, the speeches grew more and more persuasive, and after a captivating speech Booby inadvertently launched one of the largest rebellions to date, with over half of the populace turning against Lord Maximus. 

Lord Maximus' men could not stop the rioters, for they included many soldiers' friends and family. Extensive damage was done to the city, and Lord Maximus' palace was bombarded by Molotov Cocktails and cannons stolen from the city armory. The rioters demanded the head of Lord Maximus, and over the course of the night managed to break into the Royal Palace a total of four times, each time being repulsed by the Maximilian Guard. 

Booby Blagoona was able to calm the rioters by delivering a speech claiming that men, both white and black, should not fight eachother. Frenzied riots turned into cheerful protests, but by the time the rioters began to settle down, the Lord's personal army that had accompanied him on many of his greatest victories arrived, as they had received late news of the siege. Armed and equipped with the best gear on the face of the planet, Lord Maximus set his vanguard loose on the mutinous citizens, and in a slaughter that lasted for weeks, around 300,000 dissenters were killed. Booby Blagoona managed to evade capture by being shepherded away by sympathizers.

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Fucker Joe</b></font>

Joseph A. Philadelphus, known colloquially as Fucker Joe, was a Hard-Glazed serial killer, kidnapper, rapist, necrophile, and pedophile who sodomized and murdered several hundred people over the span of six years (as well as over a thousand black-hides), before being caught by a detachment of Honor Guard Powderboys (who then ironically sodomized him). 

Fucker Joe is infamous for being the primary cause of Lord Maximus' court reforms, including the controversial Fourth Erotica Ban (22), which by extension means he was indirectly responsible for the death of Boxer H. Krammy. This was due to his defense, mainly based on the fact that "a Philimonjio could do nothing wrong." This argument made the trial one of the most difficult and daunting cases in Glazic court history. During his crime spree spanning just over six years, the Glazic peoples were stricken by fear, due to the randomness of the victims and Fucker Joe's inability to be caught. 

Executed after an agonizing seventy-four spoonings in the Third Era after being found guilty of no less than 408 counts of kidnapping, 405 counts of assault, 358 counts of murder, and 42 counts of attempted murder, Fucker Joe broke the record for the amount of spoonings endured on Death Row, a precedent set by Booby Blagoona several decades prior, for inciting mass riots against Lord Maximus' regime. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Origins</b></font>

Not much is known of Fucker Joe's early life, but several sources from the time indicate that he was born to a peasant farming family on the outskirts of District 2. Farming, contrary to popular belief, was not a profession exclusive to darkhidees at the time, for white farmers had access to superior tools and equipment. Even so, it was a laborious task, and contributed to Fucker Joe's mind-blowing physique which he would rely on to strangle his victims. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page2 = [[
After reaching adulthood, Fucker Joe joined the Glazic Royal Army, fighting alongside Lord Maximus' loyal men in many wars against the dark hide. It is from this training that Fucker Joe truly became the killing machine that was feared by the Glazic populace. On his campaigns with Lord Maximus, Fucker Joe had encounters with many a dark-hide, resulting in the inevitable corruption of his mind, known today as Post-darkhide-Encounter Disorder. PNED was not originally believed to have existed back in those days, and so, Fucker Joe went without treatment, and eventually went mad. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>First Killings</b></font>

After distinguishing himself in service, Fucker Joe was honorably discharged with generous benefits, buying a home and his signature vintage 1970's muscle car, used to run down many darkhides and victims alike. Modifications to this car included a frontally-mounted M2 Browning, an enlarged trunk to store victims, and the removal of the passenger-side seat for storage of weapons and tools. 

Fucker Joe, driven mad supposedly by PNED, began his rampage in the rural territories of the Province of Louisiana, kidnapping over 150 women and torturing and murdering them all. During his year of activity in the Province of Louisiana he was averaging just over an abduction/torture/murder per three days. Fucker Joe also infamously drove onto the Governor's plantation (through three fences and several guards), running down many merry-go berry o' pickin' darkhides while they were chained together and defenseless. 

Fucker Joe's car received extensive damage from security, as well as the drug-fuelled Governor firing at him with a repeating carbine from his balcony of his castle-mansion. However, even though his initial objectives were not met, Fucker Joe escaped alive and with his car in working condition. After extensive repairs, Fucker Joe set off to the west to victimize the Royal Districts. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page3 = [[
<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Massacre of Willtan Forest</b></font>

Leaving the Governor's burning plantation, Fucker Joe took Lord Maximus' extravagant Highway of Victory to District 1, but took a detour into the national park of Willtan Forest (named after a famous minister, Karmine Willtan). In the forest he abducted and murdered over fifty women, but two managed to escape with their lives, reporting their encounter with Fucker Joe to the authorities. 

In accordance with Code 46, the Glazic minister in charge of the National Park dispatched a security force of Powderboys to deal with the man who was terrorizing his grounds. The Powderboy patrol covered an average of fifty miles a day, running in full sprint to find the assailant. 

Fucker Joe, however, was already on his way out of Willtan Forest (having grown bored of it), but unfortunately stumbled upon the Powderboy patrol, which actually numbered in the hundreds. Fucker Joe accelerated his muscle car to speeds which he hadn't thought possible, and began firing the front-mounted .50 cal machine-gun at the wall of powdered boys of noble stature rushing at him in human waves. The .50 cal hollow-point rounds shredded and gored innumerable amounts of the Powderboys, but the powder-clad warriors maintained their advance, and then were promptly run down by the car. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Panic, Final Murders, and Lord Maximus' Divine Intervention </b></font>

By now, most of the Glazic population had heard the rumors of disappearances, murders, and massacres. In District 1, Lord Maximus stood atop the Golden Balcony of his palace, overlooking the chaos and anarchy that consumed District 1. Panic-stricken citizens looted, stole, and burned, as they tried to prepare themselves for the coming of the anti-christ. Lord Maximus knew that to stop this chaos he had to personally stop Fucker Joe. 
]]

Book_Fucker_Page4 = [[
Lord Maximus assembled his Powderboy Honor Guard, and dispatched a legion of them (numbering in the 30,000s) to hunt down and kill Fucker Joe. Armed to the teeth with rocket launchers, machine-guns, and heavy rifles, the Powderboy Honor Guard set out, from the Iron Gate of Glaze. In actuality, however, the Iron Gate of Glaze was never opened, but was only stated to have opened in government propaganda. 

Meanwhile, Fucker Joe was rampaging through the suburbs of District 1, destroying entire shacks full of darkhides on their plantations while they slept, torching them with a flamethrower. The Powderboy Honor Guard arrived one night as he was torching a shack full of women and children darkhides from the District 1 sub-overseer's plantation. The Honor Guard captured and tortured Fucker Joe for two hours outside as the wails of the women and children burning alive filled the night. 

<font color='#000' size='4'><b>Trial and Spooning</b></font>

In the Grand Courthouse in the grounds of the Small Senate, Fucker Joe was put on trial for his crimes. Lord Maximus himself was the presiding judge of the case. Fucker Joe, surprising many of those in the courtroom, announced his intention to represent himself in the court of Glazic Law. Indeed, Fucker Joe was an eloquent and persuasive speaker, likely contributing to his success as a serial killer. Fucker Joe's primary defense shocked the civilized world. 

A Philimonjio, he argued, could do no wrong. 

Even Lord Maximus, the creator of Glazic Law and the all-knowing god-king of Philimonjio, was taken aback at this argument. However, Lord Maximus being the cunning superhuman he was, soon regained his composure and countered his point. Proclaiming that Fucker Joe was no longer a Philimonjio by his decree, Lord Maximus quickly invalidated Fucker Joe's argument. He was quickly found guilty and dragged away to the spooning chambers screaming, by two eight foot tall ludicrous darkhides.

To those that read this. Be it discarded by those who are of faiths rivalry or history that has born leeway in blood. History tells us quite a lot.

The political works of Krammy and his incentization of the Royale Senate, the dissolvation of Said senate by Lord Maximilliams hands, the attack upon the gores Great Tree by Glazic forces, and the scouring of Satan. 
It's enough to almost sympathize with he-whom-shall-not-be-named. What proof do we have that with his departure, will we even return to greater things? We don't. 
But it's in this conflict, I learnt a second thing. We fight to exist.
